# MultiplayerFPSSample
This is the first bigger project I have been working on.
I followed a Tutorial series by Brackeys for creating a multiplayer FPS Game.

I finished every video and it gave a good first look into networked games in general. 
Unfortunately he quit the series and did not completely finish it.

Nevertheless it is a functional basic game at this state.

## Images and Explanation

The first thing you will see is a login screen where you can either login to your existing account or register a new one.

After this step you get to either create a lobby or join one.

Then you finally get to play the game. 
As I said it it still very basic. 
You can kill each other and get respawned.
There is no win condition yet, so it's more or less a lobby before the real game.
